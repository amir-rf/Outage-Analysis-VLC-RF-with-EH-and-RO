## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the MATLAB functions and scripts used to reproduce the numerical results from the following paper:

**"Outage Analysis of Hybrid VLC/RF Networks With an Energy Harvesting Relay and Random Receiver Orientation"**

In this work, we investigate an indoor downlink **cooperative hybrid VLC/RF system** that uses a relay to reduce the system's outage probability. Information is delivered to the end user through either:

- A **direct VLC link** from an LED mounted on the ceiling, or  
- An **indirect RF link** via a decode-and-forward relay.

The relay is powered by **energy harvested** from the LED’s **DC-biased optical signal**, enabling it to forward data when needed.
