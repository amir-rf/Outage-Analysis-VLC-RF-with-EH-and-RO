IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 2024.

This work investigates an indoor downlink cooperative hybrid VLC/RF system that employs a relay to reduce outage probability. Information is delivered to the end user either:

Directly via a VLC link from an LED on the ceiling, or

Indirectly via an RF link through a decode-and-forward relay.

The relay operates using energy harvested from the LED's DC-biased optical signal.
